# Travel_Aggregator_Analysis

Scenario

Travelling has significantly changed thanks to technology. In the earlier days, it was not
easy to travel as booking journeys used to be a hassle, where people needed to contact
travel agents, get prices and then do a lot of paperwork.
But, with the advent of online apps, it becomes easier to book tickets. However, one
challenge is still there. Due to many available apps which offer bookings, there can be a lot
of comparisons for getting the best price.
A new Indian start-up, "MyNextBooking” is an aggregator on top of the available top
platforms (Yatra, MMT, Goibibo). It helps the user compare prices for their upcoming
journeys on its platform and the customer is redirected to the desired platform after
looking at the price.
However, they need to do a lot of analysis of the data which they have collected over a
while.
As a newly hired analyst and proficiency in Python, your role is to help them perform an indepth analysis.
Objective: Please provide answers to the following questions:
1) Find the number of distinct bookings, sessions, and searches from the given data
sets.
2) How many sessions have more than one booking?
3) Which days of the week have the highest number of bookings? Also, draw a pie
chart to show the distribution for all days of the week?
4) For each of the service names, display the total number of bookings and the total
Gross Booking Value in INR.
5) For customers who have more than 1 booking, which is the most booked route
(from_city to to_city)?
6) Which are the top 3 departure cities from where customers book mostly in advance,
provided that there have been at least 5 departures from that city?
7) Plot a heatmap displaying correlations of the numerical column and report which
pair of numerical columns in the bookings data set, have the maximum correlation?
8) For each service, which is the most used device type for making bookings on the
platform?
9) Plot the trends at a quarterly frequency for the number of bookings by each of the
device types, that is, plot a time series for each year and quarter showing the
number of bookings performed by each device type.
10) Consider the following example:
12 customers performed a total of 100 searches but only a few of them performed
10 bookings in total.

Searches = 100 bookings = 10 customers = 12
The overall booking to search ratio, Ober, is 10/100 = 0.1 Using the above
information/context, answer the following:
• What is the average oBSR for each month of the year?
• What is the average oBSR for each day of the week?
• Plot a time series of oBSR on all the given dates.
